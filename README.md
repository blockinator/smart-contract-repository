# Smart Contract Repository for Ethereum and Tron

Contains Token, Crowdsale, and ICO smart contract code

## Note
Tron is fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts.

But you will need to change Ether denominations into TRX denominations!
e.x. the current exchange rate is 1 ETH to 14,452 TRX so 0.001 ETH would become 14.452 TRX
