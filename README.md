# Smart Contract Repository for TRON, Ethereum and EOS

Contains Token, Crowdsale, and ICO smart contract code

## Note

Tron is fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts. 

But you will need to change Ether denominations into TRX denominations!
e.x. the current exchange rate is 1 ETH to 6,005 TRX so 0.001 ETH would become 6.0 TRX
